# BBCTRL Firmware - Product Description

## What This Project Is
BBCTRL is a complete, open-source CNC controller firmware that transforms a Raspberry Pi and AVR microcontroller into a professional-grade CNC machine controller. It provides all the software needed to control CNC machines including mills, lathes, routers, and other automated equipment.

## Problems It Solves
- **High Cost of Commercial Controllers**: Traditional CNC controllers are expensive proprietary systems
- **Limited Flexibility**: Commercial controllers often lack customization options
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Proprietary systems limit hardware choices and future upgrades
- **Lack of Open Standards**: Closed-source controllers hinder innovation and community development
- **Complex Setup**: Many controllers require specialized hardware and software knowledge

## How It Works
The system operates as a distributed controller with three main components:

1. **AVR Microcontroller**: Handles real-time motion control, stepper motor driving, and I/O operations
2. **Raspberry Pi Backend**: Runs the main application server, handles GCode processing, and manages communications
3. **Web-based Frontend**: Provides the user interface accessible from any modern web browser

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Interface**: Web-based control that's accessible from any device
- **Real-time Feedback**: Live status updates, position monitoring, and error reporting
- **Powerful Features**: GCode editor, 3D visualization, camera integration, and advanced configuration
- **Reliable Operation**: Robust error handling and safety features
- **Extensible Design**: Support for various CNC machines and peripherals through modular architecture

## Key User Journeys
1. **Machine Setup**: Easy configuration of axes, motors, and peripherals
2. **GCode Programming**: Built-in editor with syntax highlighting and error checking
3. **Job Execution**: Load programs, simulate toolpaths, and run jobs with real-time monitoring
4. **Maintenance**: Access to logs, diagnostics, and system health monitoring
5. **Customization**: Configure I/O, add peripherals, and extend functionality

## Success Metrics
- **Ease of Use**: New users can set up and operate CNC machines within hours
- **Reliability**: Consistent performance across different machine configurations
- **Community Adoption**: Growing user base and contributor community
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Support for wide range of CNC machines and components
- **Performance**: Sub-millimeter precision and smooth motion control
